# discord-public-flags
Retrieve information from Discord User's public_flags number.

<h2>How they work</h2>
<p>Discord uses an Int system for storing public flags</p>
<p>One value is twice the previous, this prevents overlap, but requires a sequential process for detemining values (highest to lowest)</p>
